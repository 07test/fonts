Hind Siliguri is an Open Source typeface supporting the Bengali/Bangla and Latin scripts. 
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, the Hind font family includes five styles. 
Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. 
The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text.

Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind for the Indian Type Foundry, who first published the fonts in 2015.
