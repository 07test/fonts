Biryani (बिरयानी) is a libre font development project. 
Currently, support for the Devangari and Latin scripts is offered. 
The design takes the form of a geometric, monolinear sans. 
Both the Devanagari and Latin character sets are original work developed by Dan Reynolds and Mathieu Réguer.

The Biryani typeface falls more along the display spectrum. 
It is not quite a design intended for the setting of text meant for immersive reading. 
In addition to Western and Central European languages, Biryani may be be  to set text in languages written in the Devanagari script, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit, etc.

The Martel Sans project is led by Dan Reynolds, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany.
