<p>Wavefont is a variable font with a Weight, Round, and Vertical Alignment axes for rendering data: waveforms, spectrums, diagrams, bars etc.</p>

<p>Wavefont bars correspond to values from 0 to 100, assigned to different characters:<br/>
- 0-9 chars are for simplified manual input with step 10 (bar height = number).<br/>
- a-zA-Z for extended manual input with step 2, softened at edges a and Z (bar height = number of letter).<br/>
</p>

<p>letter-spacing CSS property with ch units is useful to adjust distance between bars, 1ch === 1 bar width.</p>
