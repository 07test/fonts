    Gajraj (the king of elephants) is a Latin display typeface with Devanagari language support. The design is
    envisioned for large hoardings, signage and print collaterals for branding &amp; advertisements. Being one of the
    designer&rsquo;s first attempts on the Devanagari script, the font is released as a single variant display typeface.
